# 3. Fire-what!? 🔥

For this app, we'll use **Firebase** as our **backend**. If you don't know what Firebase is, it's an entire platform provided by Google that can handle almost every aspect of your app's infrastructure.

* For example, they provide a database, file storage, push notifications, hosting, among other things.
* For this workshop, we'll use Firestore, their new NoSQL database that has built-in real-time and offline features.
* This gives us two things out of the box, the content you change in the database gets updated real-time in every app that's connected, and it has offline sync without you doing extra work.

You can learn more about Firebase at [**firebase.google.com**](https://firebase.google.com/) and use it for future projects.

{% hint style="success" %}
Since we want to focus on building the actual app on this workshop **we have already created a Firebase app for you** to connect to, and we'll share the credentials with you later on this step
{% endhint %}

## Installing Firebase 🔥

The first thing we need to do to start using Firebase is to install it in our project since Stackblitz handles that part for us.

Go to the "**DEPENDENCIES**" section on your left panel and in the input box that says **Enter package name,** and type **firebase**, then hit enter.

{% hint style="info" %}
The package name needs to be written in **lowercase**, if you use uppercase it will show you an error saying it can't find it
{% endhint %}

That gives you access to the entire Firebase SDK for web development. Now, we can take things one step further and install `@angular/fire` and `@firebase/util`.

* `@angular/fire` is a library created by people from both the Firebase and the Angular teams, and it gives you better integration with Firebase when you're working on Angular projects.
* `@firebase/util` is a utility library from Firebase that is needed starting from version 5.8.0.

You can install it by typing `@angular/fire` in the input box that says **Enter package name** the same way you installed **Firebase**, then do the same for `@firebase/util`.

Once both are installed you can go into `package.json` and see the package names there, if you don't, feel free to ask one of the mentors for help 🖐

## Connect your app with Firebase 🔌

Now that Firebase is installed we need to let our Angular app know how it will communicate with it. For that, we'll go to the `app.module.ts` file and initialize Firebase. 

It generally looks like this: 👇

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="app.module.ts" %}
```javascript
@NgModule({

  imports: [BrowserModule, ReactiveFormsModule],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
})
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

It's a 2-step process. First, we need to import the packages we're going to use, so go ahead and add this to your imports: 👇

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="app.module.ts" %}
```typescript
import { AngularFireModule } from '@angular/fire';
import { AngularFirestoreModule } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

`@angular/fire` is modular, which means we only import what we'll use, in this case, we need the base functionality and Firestore.

And second, we'll add both `AngularFireModule` and `AngularFirestoreModule` to our imports array: 👇

```javascript
@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AngularFireModule.initializeApp({
      apiKey: 'AIzaSyBIM6XVuaqeBDtyyB9Ef1U5oUv9Cue9BK8',
      authDomain: 'first-firebase-angular.firebaseapp.com',
      databaseURL: 'https://first-firebase-angular.firebaseio.com',
      projectId: 'first-firebase-angular',
      storageBucket: 'first-firebase-angular.appspot.com',
      messagingSenderId: '306103315077',
    }),
    AngularFirestoreModule,
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent]
})
```

We're adding `AngularFireModule` and calling the `.initializeApp()` method to connect our app to Firebase. The `.initializeApp()` method takes an object as a parameter, that object is our credential object, which lets Angular know **which** Firebase app it needs to connect to.

* You'll copy those same credentials, the idea is we all share the same app and work faster that way.
* We're also adding the `AngularFirestoreModule` to let Angular know we'll be using the Firestore database in our project.

In the end, the entire file should look like this:

{% code-tabs %}
{% code-tabs-item title="app.module.ts" %}
```typescript
import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
import { AppComponent } from './app.component';
import { AngularFireModule } from '@angular/fire';
import { AngularFirestoreModule } from '@angular/fire/firestore';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    BrowserModule,
    AngularFireModule.initializeApp({
      apiKey: 'AIzaSyBIM6XVuaqeBDtyyB9Ef1U5oUv9Cue9BK8',
      authDomain: 'first-firebase-angular.firebaseapp.com',
      databaseURL: 'https://first-firebase-angular.firebaseio.com',
      projectId: 'first-firebase-angular',
      storageBucket: 'first-firebase-angular.appspot.com',
      messagingSenderId: '306103315077',
    }),
    AngularFirestoreModule,
  ],
  declarations: [AppComponent],
  bootstrap: [AppComponent],
  providers: [],
})
export class AppModule {}
```
{% endcode-tabs-item %}
{% endcode-tabs %}

## Next Steps 🔍

Once you're ready, move to the next step where we'll start building the **C** part of CRUD, we'll add the functionality to create a TV show and save it to the database!

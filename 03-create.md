# How to store info in our database

In the previous lesson, we connected our app to Firebase. Now it's time to start writing content into the database, for that we need a couple of things:

- A form that lets us write the content.
- A function that takes that content and sends it to Firestore.
- A way of knowing the content was saved successfully.

With that in mind let's begin with number 1, we want to create a button that when clicked generates a new TVShow card for us and stores the information inside the **Firestore Database**.

For that the first thing we'll do is to create the button in out `app.componente.html` file, go ahead and remove everything from that file and make it look like this:

```html
<header>
  <h1>TV SERIES!</h1>
  <p>ðŸ“º Your favorite TV Shows ðŸ“º</p>
</header>

<div class="add">
  <button (click)="add()">ADD</button>
</div>
```

We're adding a page title and a button, when clicked, the button will call the `add()` function inside our `app.component.ts`. You're probably thinking, "_but I don't have an add() function_", and we know, that why we're going to create it right away.

First, we'll do a bit of house keeping, TypeScript is great because it lets us define types for our objects, that way we get better editor integration with auto-complete or detect syntax errors on the spot!

We want to create a type for our TV Shows, that way every part of our app knows exactly how a TV Show looks like, to create that type we'll use the **Angular Generator**, go ahead and right-click on the `app/` folder, go to **Angular Generator** and click on **Interface** as shown in the image below.

![Generating an Interface](img/create-interface.png)

Name your interface `show`.

The file name should be **show.interface.ts**, if it isn't you can right click it and rename it.

Once that's done, let's add the properties we want inside the interface, a show should have an ID, a name, and a picture, so open `show.interface.ts` and make it look like this:

```js
export interface Show {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  picture: string;
}
```

Now we can go to our `app.component.ts` file and start creating our apps functionality.

The first thing we need to do is to import everything we'll need inside the file:

```js
import { Component } from '@angular/core';
import { Observable } from 'rxjs';
import { Show } from './show.interface';
import { AngularFirestore, AngularFirestoreCollection } from '@angular/fire/firestore';
```

We're importing:

- `Observable` because Firebase services return Observables and we want to use correct types.
- `Show` because our Observables are going to be of type `Show` (_remember the Interface we just created_).
- `AngularFirestore` to be able to interact with our Firestore database.
- `AngularFirestoreCollection` because that's the type Firestore collections use.

After that we'll create 2 class properties, right before our `constructor()`:

```js
showCollection: AngularFirestoreCollection<Show>;
showList: Observable<Show[]>;
```

We're creating:

- `showCollection` as a reference to the Firestore collection where our data will be stored.
- `showList` this is the list that will hold all of our shows and lets us display them in the page.

Then we need to initialize everything inside our `constructor()`:

```js
constructor(private db: AngularFirestore) {
  this.showCollection = db.collection('shows');
  this.showList = this.showCollection.valueChanges();
}
```

What `this.showCollection = db.collection('shows');` is doing is to create a reference to a Firestore collection called 'shows', think of it as creating a direct route to the place where we'll store our TV Shows.

And then `this.showList = this.showCollection.valueChanges();` is taking that reference and transforming it into an `Observable` which is a list we can then display on the page.

After that it's time to create the actual `add()` function, remember, our `TVShow` has 3 properties, an ID, a name, and a picture, so we need to send those 3 properties to Firestore.

Go ahead and after our `constructor()` add:

```js
add() {
  const id = this.db.createId();
  const picture = this.getRandomPicture();
  const name = '';
  this.showCollection
    .doc(id)
    .set({ name, picture, id });
}

getRandomPicture() {
  const randomNumber = Math.round(Math.random() * 20);
  return 'https://picsum.photos/100/100?image=' + randomNumber;
}
```

Here's what's goin on, first, the `getRandomPicture()` function takes the URL or a page that's to create random images and starts passing it random numbers to generate random links, this returns a URL that we can pass to any `<img></img>` tag and render in the page.

Then let's disect the `add()` function line by line:

- First, we're using `const id = this.db.createId()` to create a new random ID for our show, then assign that ID to the `id` variable.
- Second, we're using `const picture = this.getRandomPicture()` to create an image link and assign it to the `picture`variable.
- We're setting the name variable to an empty string with `const name = ''`.
- Then we're going into our `showCollection` reference and with `.doc(id)` we're saying, "_hey, from that show list go into this specific show_".
- And lastly we're using `.set({ name, picture, id })` to set the properties inside the object.

## Next Steps

Right now your app can talk to Firebase, go ahead, play with it, see if everything looks alright and then get ready to move to the next section where we'll show all the cards you're creating on the page :)

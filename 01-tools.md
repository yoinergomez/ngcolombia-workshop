# 2. The tools ðŸ”¨

For this workshop we'll use Angular and Firebase, but instead of installing a bunch of packages, tools, and editors, we'll use **Stackblitz ðŸ’¡**

## What's Stackblitz? ðŸ¤”

It's a code editor you don't need to install. It runs on the web browser and handles everything for you.

And when we say everything, **we mean it**. It gives you the editor, installs the packages for you, and even has a view where you can see the result of your app in real-time with live-reload \(_that's just fancy word to say the view updates when you write new code_\).

The first thing you'll need to do is head over to [**https://stackblitz.com/**](https://stackblitz.com/) where you'll see something like this:

You'll head over to **"START A NEW PROJECT"** and click on Angular, it will create a new Angular project for you with all the dependencies. You'll see something like this:

* On the left panel, you'll have the folder structure, you can click on any file there and it will open it for you.
* On the middle panel, you'll see the opened file. That's your code, and every edit you do there we'll appear live in the right panel.
* On the right panel, you'll have a real-time view of your app.

Go ahead, play with it, open the `app.component.html` and change the text inside the `<p></p>` tags to whatever you want, you'll see it updated in real-time in your right panel.

## What about the styles? ðŸ’…

The goal for this workshop is to get you comfortable writing code against a cloud backend. We won't focus on styles but since we want everything to look nice we're giving you the **default CSS** for the app.

Once you're ready, move to the next step, where you'll learn how to **connect Firebase** with your Angular app.

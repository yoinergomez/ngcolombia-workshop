# 01-tools

For this workshop we'll use Angular and Firebase, but rather than making you install a bunch of packages, tools, and editor, we'll use **Stackblitz**.

## What's Stackblitz?

It's a code editor you don't need to install. It runs on the web browser and handles everything for you.

And when we say everything, we mean it. It gives you the editor, installs the packages for you, and even has a view where you can see the result of your app in real-time with live-reload \(_that's just fancy word to say the view updates when you write new code :-P_\)

The first thing you'll need to do is head over to [https://stackblitz.com/](https://stackblitz.com/) where you'll see something like this:

![Stackblitz project type selection](.gitbook/assets/stackblitz-create.png)

You'll head over to "START A NEW PROJECT" and click on Angular, it will create a new Angular project for you with all the dependencies.

You'll see something like this:

![Angular Folder Structure](.gitbook/assets/stackblitz-angular-folder.png)

On the left panel, you'll have the folder structure, you can click on any file there and it will open it for you.

On the middle panel, you'll see the opened file. That's your code, and every edit you do there we'll appear live in the right panel.

On the right panel, you'll have a real-time view of your app.

Go ahead, play with it, open the `app.component.html` and change the text inside the `<p></p>` tags to whatever you want, you'll see it updated in real-time in your right panel.

Once you're ready, move to the next step, where you'll learn how to connect Firebase with your Angular app.

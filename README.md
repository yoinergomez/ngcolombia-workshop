# Build your first Firebase powered Angular app

First of all, thank you. We know it's not easy to take time out of your weekend, so we're grateful you decided to trust we'll make it worth it :-)

## What we'll build

Throughout this workshop, we'll build a light version of IMDB (_Internet Movie Database_), a place where we'll keep a record of our favorite TV Shows or movies.

It'll be something simple yet powerful enough to teach you the core concepts of building apps with Firebase and Angular.

You'll learn:

- How to connect your app with Firebase.
- How to fetch a list of items from Firebase and display them on the screen.
- How to create a new item and add it to that list.
- How to edit one of those items.
- How to delete one of those items.
- How Angular components communicate with each other.

In other words, you'll leave this workshop with the ability to interact with your Firebase database (_we'll use the new Firestore DB_) and handle all CRUD operations (_Create, Read, Update, and Delete_).

## Before we get started

We want you to know a few things:

- All the mentors came here for you, so please, feel free to call them and ask them as many questions as you want :-)
- We want to make sure that everyone finishes the workshop, so if you finish one of the steps, do take a look around your table to see if you can help anyone else before moving to the next step.
- We'll have a short intro at the beginning of each exercise, and a short recap at the end.

That's it, have a wonderful time and remember, we're here for you :-)

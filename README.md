# 1. Welcome 💜

First of all, thank you. We know it's not easy to take time out of your weekend, so we're grateful you decided to trust us. We'll make it worth it 💪

Before we start, remember:

* 🙌 We follow a Code of Conduct to ensure everyone a safe and comfortable space. Read it [**here**](https://www.ngcolombia.com/coc).
* 📷 Please let us know if you don't want to appear in photos or videos made during the event, otherwise, we'll assume consent.
* 🖐 Take care of your belongings! We won't be responsible for them.

## So what are going to build? 🤔

Throughout this workshop, we'll build a light version of [**IMDb**](https://www.imdb.com/) \(_Internet Movie Database_\), a place where we'll keep a record of our favorite TV Shows or movies.

It will be something simple yet powerful enough to teach you the core concepts of building apps with Firebase and Angular. You'll learn:

* 🔌 How to **connect** your app with Firebase
* 💻 How to **fetch** a list of items from Firebase and display them on the screen.
* 📃 How to **create** a new item and add it to that list.
* 📝 How to **edit** one of those items.
* 💀 How to **delete** one of those items.

In other words, you'll leave this workshop with the ability to interact with your **Firebase database** \(we'll use the new **Firestore**\) and handle all **CRUD** operations \(Create, Read, Update, and Delete\).

## Before we get started 🖐

We want you to know a few things:

* 👉 All the mentors came here for you, so please, feel free to call them and ask them as many questions as you want!
* 👉 We want to make sure that everyone finishes the workshop, so if you finish one of the steps, **do take a look around** your table to see if you can help anyone else before moving to the next step.

That's it, have a wonderful time and remember, we're here for you 💜
